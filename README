# MLOps Task 1

This project demonstrates a basic MLOps workflow with a focus on Docker-based deployment and orchestration using Docker Compose.

## Project Overview

- Containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
- Uses Docker Compose to manage multi-container setups (e.g., app, database, etc.).
- Simplifies local development and production deployment.

## Application Details

The core application is a form that allows user to submit data and displays it on the same webpage. it maintains a datbase to store every entry and displays it.

## Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker Image**

    ```
    docker build -t mlops-task1-app .
    ```

2. **Run the Container**

    ```
    docker run -p 8000:8000 mlops-task1-app
    ```

    - Replace `8000` with your application's port if different.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

1. **docker-compose.yml**

    Example structure:
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      app:
         build: .
         ports:
            - "8000:8000"
         environment:
            - ENV=production
      # Add other services (e.g., db) as needed
    ```

2. **Start All Services**

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Stop All Services**

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Notes

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
- Customize the `docker-compose.yml` as per your project requirements.
- For production, consider using environment variables and secrets management.
